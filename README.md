# 🦜️🔗 Go LangChain

⚡ Building applications with LLMs through composability ⚡

> **Notice: The library is in a very early stage of development.**

## 📦 Installation

```bash
go get github.com/lab99x/go-langchain
```

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling
developers to build applications that they previously could not.
But using these LLMs in isolation is often not enough to
create a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library is aimed at assisting in the development of those types of applications.

## Relationship with Python LangChain

This library is the Go language implementation of [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain). 

The [LangChainHub](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain-hub) is a central place for the serialized versions of these prompts, chains, and agents.
